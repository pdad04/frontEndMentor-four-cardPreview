## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

his note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to usee [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) to work on more responsive layouts to continue enhancing my CSS skills to be able to create and use my own custom CSS for projects instead of frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This site is a great help with CSS in general. I used this to get most of the details with Flexbox, the basic understanding and properties of flex.
